A few assumptions were made about parsing syntax:
    - With defined behavior:
        - inside a subshell command, multiple newlines are treated the same as
          a single newline (i.e., a SEQUENCE_COMMAND)
        - ";\n" is treated as "\n", ";)" is treated as ")"
        - a command such as "a < b c" is parsed as "a c < b" (which is the same
          as bash's behavior)
        - multiple of the same redirect are overridden (e.g., "a < b < c" is
          parsed as "a < c")
    - With undefined behavior (per the spec):
        - two "(" in a row, with optional whitespace in between, causes a syntax
          error
        - a digit-only word before/after a redirect operator is treated the
          same as a regular word

There are no limitations I'm aware of, and I haven't added any extra features.
